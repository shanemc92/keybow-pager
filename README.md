# keybow-pager

lua code to extend the keybow pimoroni system to support multiple pages of operations, thus extending the number
of possible operations.

The four pages can be switched using button 12 which is the top-right under the Keybow text on the PCB. This cycles through the various tabs of
operations for the other 11 buttons

## Installation

copy the keybow-pager directory and the keys.lua file on the root of your EFI filesystem.
