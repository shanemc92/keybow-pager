# keybow-pager

lua code to extend the keybow pimoroni system to support four "pages", thus extending the number
of possible operations.

The four pages can be switched as tabs using the topmost four buttons. This changes the behavior of
the operations on the remaining buttons

## Installation

copy the keybow-pager directory and the keys.lua file on the root of your EFI filesystem.
